# Python / Godot Intro
This repository holds files for an introduction course to Game-Programming with the Godot engine. This course was created for people with minimal programming knowledge, therefore it starts out with some lessons in python before getting into Godot and gdscript. 

All notes and slides where originally created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) but should still be viewable with most markdown viewers. 

The tasks in the Sessions folders are example solutions for specific puzzles on [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/home). 
A link to the specific puzzle can be found in the comments in each file.
