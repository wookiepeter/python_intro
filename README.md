# Python Intro
This repository holds notes and example files related to an introduction to the python language

All notes and slides where originally created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) but should still be viewable with most markdown viewers. 

The tasks in the Sessions folders are example solutions for specific puzzles on [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/home). 
A link to the specific puzzle can be found in the comments in each file.
