# Godot Workshop
--- 
## Goals
- learn basic programming skills in a commonly used language (python) 
- learn to create a basic game with the godot engine
---
## Why english slides?
- almost all programs / documentation / tutorials in the world are written in english
- most of the terminology doesn't have appropriate translation anyway
---
## Timetable
- __Session 1:  Intro to programming using python__
- Session 2: Getting to know Godot + gdscript
- Session 3: Use those skills to create a very basic game
- Session 4?!: Create a small game as a team?!
--- 
## Plan for today?
- basic concepts
- basic structure of a python program
- solve tasks on codingame
--- 
## Basic concepts - python
- high-level programming language
- relative easy-to-use, but less control / performance 
- used on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- we (and 95% of the world) are specifically using python3
--- 
## Basic concepts - game engine
- has a bunch of code ready for doing game things
	- input, rendering, animation, ... 
- includes stuff like an editor and manages assets (models, images, etc.)
--- 
## Basic concepts - godot
- game engine
- open-source
	- free to use, free to modify, free to sell
- light-weight
- very beginner-friendly
- DOES NOT USE PYTHON!
--- 
## Why two languages?
- python is the most useful language for all of you
	- easy to learn
	- can be used to do pretty much anything (science, machine learning, math, ...)
- BUT
	- no big game-engine uses python
---
## Basic concepts - gdscript
- programming language made for godot
- main language for usage in godot
- looks and feels a lot like python
- functions a little different, but not significant for now
--- 
## Disclaimer
- I only have limited experience with python
- I only have some experience with godot
- BUT I have a lot of experience with other game engines and programming languages
- I might need to look up stuff, that's normal and you should do it too!
